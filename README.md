<h1>Matt Hogan</h1>
<i>Computer Science, Class of 2024</i><br><br>
<p>Hey there! My name is Matt and I'm an undergraduate student studying Computer Science at the University of Rhode Island.
I have been interested in programming and general computer knowledge as far as I can remember, so to be able to pursue that passion is pretty amazing.
On top of that, I get to bring it to another level, as I am one of five TA's for the CSC 211 - Computer Programming course.
I look forward to helping whoever may need it and sharing my love of computers with others.
If for any reason you would like to get in touch, I have provided some contact information below.</p>

<h2>CSC 211 - Computer Programming</h2>

<p>My office hours are held in-person at the top floor lounge of Tyler Hall from <b>3pm - 4pm on Tuesdays</b> and <b>10am - 12pm on Wednesdays</b>.
However, among my peers, there are office hours of different modalities every day, and you may also ask questions via Piazza, email, etc.
We are here to help you!
