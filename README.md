As an undergraduate student studying Computer Science at the University of Rhode Island, I feel as though I am one step closer to becoming the magician my younger self once believed was behind technology as we know it. With each course, I am faced with new challenges which, although sometimes stressful, have a payoff like no other. It's truly amazing to be pursuing this passion of mine and I look forward to bringing my ideas and what I learn to the industry.
